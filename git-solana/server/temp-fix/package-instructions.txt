To fix the import dependency issues in your React app, follow these steps:

1. Install CRACO:
   ```
   cd /Users/shauryaiyer/SolAR/SolAR/website/SolARexplorer_bundle
   npm install @craco/craco --save-dev
   ```

2. Copy the craco.config.js file from this directory to your React app's root directory:
   ```
   cp /Users/shauryaiyer/SolAR/SolAR/git-solana/server/temp-fix/craco.config.js /Users/shauryaiyer/SolAR/SolAR/website/SolARexplorer_bundle/
   ```

3. Update your package.json scripts section to use CRACO instead of react-scripts:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "craco start",
     "build": "craco build",
     "test": "craco test",
     "eject": "react-scripts eject"
   }
   ```

4. Run your app with:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

This solution will disable the ModuleScopePlugin which is causing your dependency issues with imports that reach outside of the src directory.

Alternative approach:
If you prefer not to use CRACO, you can:

1. Move all your external dependencies inside the src directory
2. Or add a .env file with:
   ```
   NODE_PATH=./src/..
   ```
